# Gene Assembly Visualizer

A modern web application for visualizing and comparing DNA sequence assembly algorithms with interactive 3D visualization.

## Overview

This project implements and visualizes two fundamental DNA sequence assembly algorithms:

- **[Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_assembly#Overlap-layout-consensus)** - A traditional approach that finds overlaps between reads, creates a layout, and generates consensus sequences
- **[de Bruijn Graph (DBG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_graph)** - A graph-based approach that constructs a de Bruijn graph from k-mers and finds Eulerian paths

The application provides an interactive web interface with real-time 3D visualization of assembled sequences.

## Features

### ðŸ§¬ Assembly Algorithms
- **OLC Assembly** with multiple overlap detection methods:

  - Smith-Waterman local alignment
  - Needleman-Wunsch global alignment
- **de Bruijn Graph Assembly** with:
  - Configurable k-mer size
  - Error filtering (threshold and Bloom filter)
  - Multiple Eulerian path algorithms

### ðŸŽ¨ Interactive 3D Visualization
- Real-time 3D rendering of assembled DNA sequences
- Color-coded nucleotide bases (A=Red, C=Green, G=Blue, T=Yellow)
- Interactive camera controls (zoom, rotate, pan)
- Helical DNA-like structure representation

### ðŸ“Š User Interface
- **Input Methods**: Paste sequences or upload FASTA files
- **Parameter Configuration**: Adjustable algorithm parameters

### ðŸ”§ Technical Features
- Built with React 19 and TypeScript
- 3D visualization using Three.js and React Three Fiber
- Modern UI with Flowbite React components
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Real-time parameter adjustment

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gene-assembly
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

## Usage

### Basic Assembly

1. **Input Your Data**:
   - Choose between "Paste Reads" or "Upload FASTA File"
   - For paste input, enter DNA sequences (one per line)
   - For file input, upload a FASTA format file

2. **Select Assembly Method**:
   - **OLC**: Traditional overlap-based assembly
   - **deBruijn**: Graph-based assembly

3. **Configure Parameters**:
   - Click the "Parameters" panel to adjust algorithm settings
   - Different parameters are available based on the selected method

4. **Run Assembly**:
   - Click "Assemble" to start the process
   - View real-time results and timing information

5. **Explore Results**:
   - Examine the 3D visualization of assembled sequences
   - Switch between multiple assembly variants if detected
   - Review timing breakdown for performance analysis

### Algorithm Parameters

#### OLC Parameters
- **Overlap Method**: k-mer, MinHash, Smith-Waterman, or Needleman-Wunsch
- **Layout Method**: Greedy or Superstring approaches
- **Consensus Method**: Majority voting or POA (Partial Order Alignment)
- **Thresholds**: Minimum overlap requirements and scoring parameters

#### deBruijn Parameters
- **k-mer Size**: Length of k-mers for graph construction (typically 31)
- **Error Filter**: Threshold-based or Bloom filter error correction
- **Eulerian Path**: Hierholzer or recursive path finding algorithms

## Algorithm Details

### Overlap-Layout-Consensus (OLC)

The OLC algorithm works in three main phases:

1. **Overlap Phase**: Finds overlaps between all pairs of reads using various methods
2. **Layout Phase**: Arranges reads based on overlap information to create a consensus layout
3. **Consensus Phase**: Generates the final consensus sequence from the layout

### de Bruijn Graph (DBG)

The de Bruijn graph approach:

1. **Graph Construction**: Creates a graph where nodes are (k-1)-mers and edges are k-mers
2. **Graph Simplification**: Removes tips, bubbles, and compresses linear paths
3. **Path Finding**: Finds Eulerian paths through the graph to reconstruct sequences
